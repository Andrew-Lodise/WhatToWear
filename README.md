# What to Wear
---
## Description:
This program, at 6am every day, retrieves weather data about my location using webscraping, and processes that information in order to calculate and tell me, through email, what I should wear that day.

I built this because I felt this was a process in my life that I could automate, and wanted to put my programming skills to the test.
